# Assignment 9
## .net MVC

Sometimes as developers we make or are given a prototype to turn into an app. Your task is to turn the prototype at https://github.com/hexx0960/NorthernThreads/ into a .net mvc application. You will submit your app by uploading a zip to the eConestoga assignments folder provided.

You can see the .html prototype in action at https://hexx0960.github.io/NorthernThreads/. It has 13 pages which you will turn into friendly URL based routing.  For more marks you can put the clothing products on the web site into a database. Finally you can implement the buy now button and the shopping cart.
